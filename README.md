# Independent_ANA_rewards

I am a big fan of the reward ticket system and ANA offers arguably the best reward tickets program between the US and Japan/South Korea. Unfortunately ANA issues rewards at arbitrary schedules, most likely driven by their paid ticket availability so there is no good way to find availablities within a given time frame besides manual web search. This script runs a web scraping technique on ANA's website, obtains available flight data with awards status, and forwards results within an XX-YY period to a list of email addresses. The detailed instructions on how to run is included in the script.
